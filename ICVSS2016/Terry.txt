terry winograd

I'm even though there's still hundreds of people streaming through the halls 
I'm Brad Meyers I'm the chair of the ACM SIGCOMM high awards committee and it's my great privilege to be able to introduce Terry Winograd as the winner of the sig Chi lifetime research award
So you may know that sick I gives out many awards but the big time a lifetime research award and the lifetime practice awards are our biggest honors and we honor these people with black check and also the privilege opportunity to give you a speech and hopefully and lightness about what they've learned through their lifetime of research or practice
so our lifetime Research Award winner this year is Terry Winograd 


Terry is a professor of computer science at Stanford University 
	=> where he founded and directs the program and human-computer interaction 
	=> and it doesn't mention in this player but he also founded the design school there

over the course of his forty-year career terry has made fundamental contributions to the design of interactive computer systems by taking a broad view of HCI considering it in the context of natural language processing machine in human intelligence cognitive science human machine communication design and software design

any body who's been in the field as long as we have knows that you generally come from other areas and terry has come from AI which is certainly one of the key reasons that he's been able to make so many interesting contributions that are very different than the contributions of those who come from systems or from psychology and so it's great that he's able to give us a different perspective 

After building where the most advanced natural language interactive systems of the time from his early work in AI 
=> he showed that the symbol based system was inadequate and propose a new basis for human-machine interaction and emphasize the contextualized basis of communication in the physical world 
=> thereafter he developed the consequences of these ideas for software design insert how human activities computer science and design can be united not just through a series of articles and books but also through the design and teaching of a set of classes in the founding of a new design school 

Terry has explored other dimensions of the relationship between people and computers receiving the rego Award for lifetime contributions to computer documentation from the ACM SIG cock society and the Founders Award as one of the founders of the computer professionals first social responsibility 


 

I moved steadily over towards a notion of design and by design here don't mean what the popular view of design and styling and look and so on really designed as a mode of thinking as a way of approaching problem way of approaching interactions approaching working with people so laid out direction look at the idea of computer human interaction CHI 
1) starting with something about computers interaction but not focusing on that so that's going to be a sort of prelude 
2) and then once we go further we'll take a look at what we really mean by the human computer interaction 

I followed integrating multiple devices into what we call the interactive works space, Armando Fox at Stanford and we had tabletop, we had walls, we had hand-held, we had laptops and you see, the goal was to come up with a way to integrate those into a single sort of interactive space for the users wasn't one kind of interaction another time another kind to me distinct systems technologies developed there was a startup I break them back up the students which is still going selling software in academic settings there was a very interesting specific interactions by Francois Dumontier who's here using a pen and a large high-resolution display for creative work so we call the post brainstorming with a kind of activities you do not when you're sitting down and getting stuff done in your office with your group trying to come up with creative ideas. 
=> so there is an interesting things that came out of it but I'm gonna see really successful at our larger goal of integration and I think this was one of the lessons that I learned at the end of talk about lessons in general but to turn a bunch of devices into a kind of unified environment what I realized is having a good conceptual framework isn't enough when you're dealing with the kind of energy of interaction and devices and people there's a huge variety of other social and technical and physical detail that all needs to be taken into account and it is really integration always sounds good would be wonderful if you could do it and it's much harder in practice.


I'm gonna switch to human. 
Hunan body :
	human had a long tradition about five hundred years ago after that which is interesting actually models and Josephine human properties that affect what they can do I can reach a certain distance I can focus on my can do things because of the length of my arm whatever it is this was a view of people as physical beings which is called at the time and still human factors

Natural language:
	what was put in a very intelligible way by Alan Turing was that what it means to be human is to use language you could understand and dialogue and ordinary language that would be the tests of intelligence human intelligence. 
	from the early sixties ELIZA influential caused people to think about what computers could do carried on dialogue like this you're like my father is in some way resemblance to see we're not very aggressive my father is afraid of everybody else comes to mind when you think of your father police so this is the kind of dialogue a person might have with their and what's going on in the computer side wherever eliza is a very simple pattern matching program looks for certain phrases or combinations of words and deeds the Mac I gave Eliza as a simple exercise and programming classes for many years it's very unsophisticated as a program on the other hand as amazing demonstration that computers use language like you know this is my next lesson in various places that people simply cannot refrain from projecting human qualities onto computers looks like it's doing a little humans don't you immediately reject much more human this has been studied in detail sherry Turkle has written books about how people perceive computers my colleagues byron reeves britain at Stanford done a long series of research all of which lead to this same demonstrating various aspects of people think about what computers do because they're thinking about what other people can do.

	I got into this language game with a program that probably what I'm definitely still known for SHRDLU. This is from the original screen you typed in things like "pick up a big red" SHRDLU would type things back sometimes much elaborate than "ok" and actually would carry out the operation on this graphics pretty primitive graphics.

Information processing :
	I was doing in there was a model of the human ear but striking from this picture is how similar it is to drive this is Joe and Joseph T right it's just that all the little lady at the numbers are in the head instead of in the harm relations but if the human as a measure it will set of modernity the right now this is actually from New Orleans sign in 1972 book on human problem solving I don't expect you to read it but the idea is that what the human does is like following a flowchart it's like doing a set of algorithmic steps on a bunch of data problem so I'll here was a human is an information processor things we think about when we talk about computers processing information can be projected into what it is like that they do things like decision-making and problem-solving which are well-defined operations. In New Orleans, Simon had a whole career of developing the principles of what it means to be an information processing. My own text book on language which came out a few years after the decision was called "language as a cognitive process" even though they were internal differences I would say between the carnegie school and the MIT and Stanford and so on there was an underlying sense a similar what we're talking about we talk about people from a mental perspective was something like an information processing device with a set of pieces of their properties so that writing how do the psychology in some sense you could say that the guy for the decades since then has been driven by that connection. it's been changing over the years we'll get to that but I think the guy as a study of the human properties of the human information processing as it relates to interaction has driven a lot of the theory as well as specifics it was a very different approach. 

Worker in a organisation :
	Here you have again as I write this is before the Silicon Valley dress code and is that the way you want to look at people wasn't what was going on in their head but how they interacted with the audience their capacity in a work team this is a very alternative view it later became the whole deal of \textbf{computer supported cooperative work} things it was removed from looking at the individual to looking at the interaction between people actually heard talking MIT back in the late sixties, as I mentioned I was part of the AI lab and the consensus there was a really stupid thing to do with computers they aren't smart. where is the intelligence ok so does the shipyard you don't make the view of you that think that's smart you make it be the communication tool the way that people be smart with it organization is another kind of thing and organization here you can take broadly doesn't have to mean commercial business is a vi

Information seeker :
	I was part of a project at Stanford project you notice here are some things that are very reasonable and some of their law was Z39.5 50 that was a protocol for passing around two billion traffic information which where there was a GDP on there but just just before the web and the way we thought about information with the way librarians tend to think about it well organized collections things that brought together carefully curated materials you have things like commercial information brokers and providers things like lexus nexus and so on and the goal again which was an integrative goal was to pull all of us together so that a person sitting in front of the computer could access the interfaces the payments libraries and so on in a uniform way now and I think we were trying to do a complex integration tasks which was interesting and probably more doable than the IRA in one but it all got blown away when students decided that they wanted to search the web so Larry Page and came up with Google this is a 1998 version before they had figured out how to draw nice logo idea you didn't need to organize anything you could just take what was out there on the web in whatever form it is in search of finding and I have to admit when that came up I was a bit skeptical it wasn't like I said all I see like I was like wait a minute how you gonna be on it and now very often credits me appreciate much although having given him the best advice later with the point of it is that we were able to make the switch by the media from a you have information as an organized sort of freak and structure to this you searching in a massive in unstructured way and using the sheer amount of that as the basis for being able to come up with things algorithm is a whole series of development but for me it was a real sort of mental shift from ontologies in structuring too open-ended use wide ranges and materials.
	so that from this point to you human this is a great view the web is an information seeker what do people do on the web information through Google let me get a free Yahoo they may get all sorts of ways but they seek information 

People getting together (social beings) :
	the early days in the well that was a matter of people getting together that's very different from the Google mission which is quote make all the world's information accessible and so on I didn't say anything about people getting together it is the world's information to shift from the information to the people people are social and 10 people being social is the current large amount of work on social networks here somebody's life and they're all the people there on time Wikipedia there is gives a list of major active social networking sites not included excluding ratings and there are over 200 notable well-known sites so you start with Facebook and so on but their 200 notable well known ones and tens of thousands hundreds of thousands this has become a sort of burgeoning industry of how do you do how do you see people as social be whole body of human knowledge human sciences about people and how they get along with each other and with you now along with that 

Have a meaning (celebrety on twitter) :
	So I think in design in HCI as well meaning is one of the things that the meaning of Twitter charlie is being a celebrity I have lots of followers notice a difference between on Facebook I have friends now I'm part of a community and we all like each other and on Twitter I have followers I'm famous so I'm famous is a leading question from my producer information so we can see that this view of people said they are the sorts of meaning and the question isn't so much what do people do who am'I 

Pesonal identity (who am'I) :
	This is probably the most famous internet cartoon ever dog we all have a personal identity then Who Am I the idea my friends recognize that different from the you and so on I think it's been a lot of work in HCI about personal identity things like customization tremendous amount of interesting things that can be done there but only one there is a large social life not just I'm a person who likes this and this is my hobbies and all the stuff that goes on the front page of your Facebook profile I have a reputation of some kind of social validation I think a lot of overseeing again in computer interaction playing to this kind of the news 



CPSR
	I was involved founding an organization called computer professionals for social responsibility this was a tease as a response to some very un- realistic assumptions are being made in the defense world about how computers would provide a missile shield had a number of activities in patient's about the realities computers and accuracy reliability and online which meant that you'll be depending on the missile shield that was almost later got involved with issues of privacy number of issues about how computers and I personally involved in a number of years in discussions about military funding for research has been less than mainstream computer science which for a period of years the entirely funded by DARPA the Advanced Research Projects agency's if there and there are some complex complex questions about why you should or shouldn't do that thing 

DESIGN - HCI :
	think about design as experienced a lot of Engineering Building thing but it's creating an experience and that has been the driving force in bringing designed to interact with centered centering on experience in the nineties I we brought together a group of designers from different fields as well as computer people to look at the questions of how plays out in interaction that same time were less human interaction and read mentions in about 20 years and that had designed as a key element from the beginning twenty years ago when we set up a series in which I can look around you and say a number of you have spoken it was called the series on people computer design started teaching design and later was convinced that design school school an interdisciplinary teaching program has no students or courses of its own everything is interdisciplinary between departments which is good and bad but it does keep it from ossified particular style and here is where you see that sort of list that I've been making on the right keep thinking that has been done by all of these different fields that is relevant to how people interact and the goal of the human-centered design design thinking which is ways of bringing that together in integrated wait so that you're thinking both about the person has an update the person is a committed
